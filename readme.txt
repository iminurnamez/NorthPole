This is an essentially empty project that demonstrates how to set up a multi-scene pygame apllication.  It also demonstrates how to use the pygame.movie module.

Tested on Windows 7 with Python 2.7 and Python 3.2;  Tested on Linux Mint 13 with Python 2.7.

Currently I have not had success getting the movie module to work with Python 3 on Linux.  Please let me know if you find a way to make it work.
