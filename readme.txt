               North Pole Tycoon: Old Timey-Toys Division

Times have changed and a hoop and stick doesn't impart the same joy it once did.
The Old-Timey Toys Division of Santa's Workshop has been shuttered to make room
for the rapidly growing Things Preceded By i Department. It's up to you to keep
the old-timey traditions alive and prove the Old-Timey Toys Division can pull its 
own sleigh by building a self-sufficient toy-making operation from scratch.
